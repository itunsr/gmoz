　　再说妈妈的高血压心脏病，整天说晕得很。爸爸的面部神经麻痹，体力不支。这一切都不允许我再在外边过年。
有一只小鸟在刚长出嫩芽的柳树上，脑袋来回摇摆，像是在找寻什么似的。清晨的露水很重，在野地里走一走，往往会沾湿裤脚。满地紫红色的野花，像给大地铺上了一条五彩斑斓的地毯。远处的高山上，翠竹一如往昔般绿得鲜亮，透着深绿色的光泽。白玉兰开花了，绽放出一瓣瓣嫩白色的花瓣，每一朵花都像一盏小灯笼。有的已开出了两三片花瓣儿，有的整个儿展开了，还有的像一个个白色的小莲苞。白玉兰开得淡雅，散发着朴素的光泽，看了令人心生祥和之意。近旁，随处可见一朵又一朵粉红色的桃花。桃树上的花苞一个挨着一个，像饱胀得要破裂似的。
　　长期地忧思焦虑、辛苦劳累，使妈妈患了严重的肺结核病，但苦惯了的她究竟闲不住，即便在家养病期间，依然帮着单位上张贴储蓄帐页的“耳朵”。
Ye Jie small things all packages, thanks brother wouldn't it be idle?
On the contrary, thanks brother busy.
Than Ye Jie are busy, too busy to go home to have a meal to Ye Jie shout.
Dinner Monday to Friday, Saturday, Sunday's work, don't shout won't go home for dinner.
Two shout a voice can't gather together, three four yelled, and even Ye Jie please yourself.
Ye Jie standing on the balcony of her home, half body stretched out on the balcony outside, to the upstairs downstairs, on the left to the right the opposite house cried: "Xie Ge, back on eating rice".
Ye Jie very vocal.
Her family is living in the sixth floor.
Her voice was falling from a height, the strength is enough to reach any corner of the red flag village, in everyone's ear.
Lying in the farmland in the middle of the woods, watching the clouds scud across, I have an impulse to tears.
Children running around in the woods, the laughter XiangXiangLiangLiang, never had the excitement.
A flock of sheep in the distance caught her attention, pestering father took her to see.
I quietly sitting under the tree, of the field, as a child how long, I never really like childhood again close to nature?
How long have you had, I didn't hear the sheep bleating sound?
How long have you had, did not hear the sound of the little brook flowing around?
In the city of reinforced concrete space and two point one line of life, make once fresh sensitive heart little by little you lose your dreams and desires.
Noisy noisy environment, both joy and sorrow is a chaotic fuzzy, not much time.
My heart, my once the heart of the desire to fly to that didn't take off will be broken wings?
And scenery, really only in the us now and the distance?
